The Python code contained in this repository was created in the spring of 2024 by five high school students. 

The goal was to create an AI-based chatbot to provide incoming students information about classes to register for. 
While the 200 page course catalog may intimidate students, this chatbot recommends specific classes based on input from the user. 

A semester of collaboration and revision via Scrum framework resulted in this near 400 lines of code, which was presented to a panel of STEM staff.
